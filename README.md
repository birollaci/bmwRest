Basically, this was made using springboot, with the corresponding project structure.
- I chose the gradle project building tool.
- Database management is done in HyperSQL DataBase using hibernate.
- The transaction is insured.
- Logging is done in file: /logs/application-debug.log

To run it, you need to start the main in WebshopApplication.java.
